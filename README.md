# IBM Hackathon: "FanCo"

### Background
"FanCo" hackathon project for IBM using the MEAN stack and D3.js

### Project Description and Requirements
The assignment was to create a sales dashboard for a fictive fan producer. 
The sales team needed to see sales over time in total, per product, sub-geography and sales channel; combined with weather data.
Besides that, there's a view where the sales team can get real-time weather notifications, along with signing up for daily SMS alerts.

### Tech stack
This project is built using the MEAN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS.
For data visualization we've used [D3.js](https://www.d3js.org/).
For the automatic daily SMS alerts we've used Twilio, Forecast and Cron.

### Live Deployment
The final project is deployed and can be used at [fanco.herokuapp.com](https://fanco.herokuapp.com).
